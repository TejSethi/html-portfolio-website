            About Me 
        </h2>

        <p>
            I am a hardworking and dedicated computer science student, with an eye for detail who has 2+ years of experience programming in Python and Java. 
            I am currently completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science And Communications at the University of Toronto Mississauga. 
            Through school and personal projects, I will continue to advance my knowledge of software engineering and programming.
            I am excited to seek opportunities that allow me to expand on my current knowledge base, 
            which include programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Assembly (RISC-V), and SQL. 
            Such opportunities for growth through collaboration with experienced industry professionals 
            will allow me to flourish both professionally and personally, while making valuable contributions within my technical field of choice.
